Developer Notes â€“ Adding New Flowers to flowers.json

1. Open flowers.json in a code editor.

2. Add a new entry in the format:
{
  "Sunflowers": {
    "title": "Sunflowers",
    "text": "Sunflowers symbolize warmth and loyalty...",
    "image": "sunflower.jpg",
    "audio": "sunflower.mp3"
  }
}

3. Save the new image file (e.g., sunflower.jpg) and audio file (e.g., sunflower.mp3) in the root directory.

4. In index.html, add a new button:
<button onclick="logMood('Sunflowers')">Sunflowers</button>

The new flower is now integrated dynamically via JSON.
